# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Initial Stack
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository and configure the core tech stack as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Create a new Next.js 14+ project with App Router, React 18+, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Set up Vercel for deployment, Supabase for auth/database, and Upstash Redis for caching. Initialize a monorepo or single repo structure with clear documentation and CI/CD workflows. Use npm or yarn for package management. Ensure all required dependencies are installed and configured: next@14, react@18, typescript@latest, tailwindcss@latest, @supabase/supabase-js@latest, @upstash/redis@latest.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository setup by running initial build and linting. Test deployment to Vercel and ensure Supabase connection is established. Check Redis connectivity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Project Initialization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a new repository with a logical directory structure suitable for a monorepo, using a version control system like Git.
### Details:
Create the root folder, initialize Git, and set up the initial README. Establish folders such as 'apps/', 'packages/config/', and 'packages/shared/' to organize Next.js apps, shared code, and configuration packages.

## 2. Dependency Installation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install and configure core dependencies and development tools for the monorepo, including Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and workspace management tools.
### Details:
Add a root-level package.json with Yarn or npm workspaces. Install dependencies like Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and tools such as Husky, ESLint, and Prettier. Set up workspace paths for apps and packages. Before implementation, use Context7 MCP to get the latest documentation and best practices.

## 3. Monorepo Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Configure the monorepo to support multiple apps and shared packages, ensuring proper workspace and tooling setup.
### Details:
Define workspaces in package.json, configure TypeScript project references, and set up shared linting and formatting configurations. Ensure each app and package has its own package.json and tsconfig.json as needed.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Implement automated CI/CD workflows to build, test, and deploy only the affected projects within the monorepo.
### Details:
Set up CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Vercel, or other providers) to run tests, builds, and deployments. Configure the pipeline to detect changes and trigger jobs only for impacted apps or packages.

## 5. Deployment Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Verify successful deployment of all relevant apps and services, ensuring integration with Vercel, Supabase, and Redis as required.
### Details:
Check that deployments are live and functional. Validate integrations with Supabase and Redis, and confirm that all environments are correctly configured and accessible.
