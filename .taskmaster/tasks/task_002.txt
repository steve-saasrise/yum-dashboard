# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design and Implement Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Define and implement the PostgreSQL database schema for users, creators, content, topics, and related entities.
# Details:
Design normalized tables for users, creators, content, topics, and their relationships. Use Supabase Studio for schema creation. Implement proper indexing for search and filtering. Include fields for user profiles, creator URLs, content metadata, topic assignments, and saved content. Ensure foreign key constraints and data integrity. Use Supabase migrations for versioning and reversibility.

# Test Strategy:
Test schema by inserting, updating, and querying sample data. Validate foreign key constraints and indexing performance. Test backup and restore procedures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze requirements, define entities, attributes, and relationships, and normalize the schema to minimize redundancy and ensure data consistency.
### Details:
Gather requirements from stakeholders, create an entity-relationship diagram (ERD), and apply normalization principles to structure the schema effectively.[1][3] Before implementation, use Supabase MCP to check project configuration and apply necessary setup.

## 2. Create Database Tables [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Translate the schema design into SQL table definitions, specifying appropriate data types and primary keys for each table.
### Details:
Write SQL CREATE TABLE statements based on the normalized schema, ensuring each table has a primary key and columns use optimal data types for storage and performance.[3] Before implementation, use Supabase MCP to check project configuration and apply necessary setup.

## 3. Define Indexing Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Determine which columns require indexes to optimize query performance and implement them accordingly.
### Details:
Analyze expected query patterns and add indexes (including composite and unique indexes where necessary) to support efficient data retrieval and maintain performance.[3] Before implementation, use Supabase MCP to check project configuration and apply necessary setup.

## 4. Establish Foreign Key Constraints [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Set up foreign key relationships between tables to enforce referential integrity and maintain data consistency.
### Details:
Identify relationships between tables and define foreign key constraints in the SQL schema to ensure that referenced data remains consistent and valid.[3] Before implementation, use Supabase MCP to check project configuration and apply necessary setup.

## 5. Set Up Migration Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Implement a migration system to manage schema changes over time and ensure version control of the database structure.
### Details:
Choose a migration tool or framework, create initial migration scripts for table creation, indexing, and constraints, and establish a process for future schema updates. Before implementation, use Supabase MCP to check project configuration and apply necessary setup.

## 6. Test Data Integrity and Constraints [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Validate that the schema, indexes, and constraints enforce data integrity and support required operations without errors.
### Details:
Insert, update, and delete test data to verify that primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes function as intended and that the migration process preserves data integrity.

## 7. Requirements Analysis and Data Modeling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze PRD requirements and create comprehensive data models for users, creators, content, topics, and relationships
### Details:
Extract all data requirements from PRD, identify entities (users, creators, content, topics, saved_content, email_digests), define attributes for each entity, and create initial entity relationship diagrams

## 8. Entity Relationship Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design detailed entity relationships and cardinalities between all database entities
### Details:
Define one-to-many, many-to-many relationships. Design junction tables for creator-topics, user-saved-content. Establish foreign key relationships and referential integrity rules

## 9. Database Normalization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply normalization principles to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity
### Details:
Apply 1NF, 2NF, 3NF rules. Eliminate duplicate data, separate repeating groups, and ensure atomic values. Balance normalization with performance requirements

## 10. Schema Validation and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Validate the final schema design and create comprehensive documentation
### Details:
Review schema with stakeholders, validate against use cases, create detailed documentation including data dictionary, constraints, and business rules
