# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement User Authentication and Profile Management
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop user registration, authentication, and profile management features.
# Details:
Use Supabase Auth for email/magic link and OAuth (Google, GitHub) authentication. Implement secure session management with automatic logout. Build user profile management UI for name, avatar, email, timezone, and digest preferences. Support account deletion and data export for GDPR compliance. Use react-dropzone for avatar uploads.

# Test Strategy:
Test registration, login, and profile updates. Verify OAuth integration and session management. Test account deletion and data export.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Authentication Methods Setup [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement multiple authentication methods, such as password-based, passwordless, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and single sign-on (SSO), ensuring secure integration and user training.
### Details:
Select appropriate authentication protocols (e.g., SAML, OpenID), configure MFA with at least two channels (e.g., password + OTP), and integrate SSO with trusted identity providers. Follow best practices for secure credential storage and HTTPS/TLS usage.
