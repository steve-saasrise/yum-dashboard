## 6. Comprehensive Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Conduct thorough testing of authentication, session management, profile UI, avatar upload, and GDPR features to ensure security, usability, and compliance.
### Details:
Perform unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Include security testing for authentication flows, session handling, file uploads, and GDPR-related actions. Address any identified vulnerabilities or usability issues.

## 7. Supabase Auth Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Supabase authentication with project settings and security policies
### Details:
Set up Supabase project auth settings, configure RLS policies, set up auth URLs and redirects, configure JWT settings and session management. Before implementation, use Supabase MCP to check project configuration and apply necessary setup.

## 8. Magic Link Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement passwordless authentication using magic links for user login
### Details:
Configure email templates, implement magic link sending and verification, handle expired links, add email rate limiting and security measures. Before implementation, use Supabase MCP to check project configuration and apply necessary setup.
