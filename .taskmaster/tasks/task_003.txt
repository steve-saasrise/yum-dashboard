# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement User Authentication and Profile Management
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop user registration, authentication, and profile management features.
# Details:
Use Supabase Auth for email/magic link and OAuth (Google, GitHub) authentication. Implement secure session management with automatic logout. Build user profile management UI for name, avatar, email, timezone, and digest preferences. Support account deletion and data export for GDPR compliance. Use react-dropzone for avatar uploads.

# Test Strategy:
Test registration, login, and profile updates. Verify OAuth integration and session management. Test account deletion and data export.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Authentication Methods Setup [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement multiple authentication methods, such as password-based, passwordless, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and single sign-on (SSO), ensuring secure integration and user training.
### Details:
Select appropriate authentication protocols (e.g., SAML, OpenID), configure MFA with at least two channels (e.g., password + OTP), and integrate SSO with trusted identity providers. Follow best practices for secure credential storage and HTTPS/TLS usage.

**Enhanced Supabase Configuration:**
- Created comprehensive lib/supabase.ts with multiple client types (browser, server, middleware)
- Added proper SSR support with @supabase/ssr package
- Implemented authentication configuration with OAuth and magic link settings
- Added TypeScript types for better type safety

**Authentication Context & Hooks:**
- Created hooks/use-auth.tsx (renamed from .ts to .tsx for proper JSX support) 
- Implemented comprehensive AuthProvider component with full state management
- Built authentication methods: email/password, OAuth (Google, GitHub), magic links, password reset
- Added utility hooks: useUser, useSession, useProfile, useAuthLoading, useAuthError
- Implemented password validation with configurable requirements
- Added proper error handling and loading states

**Technical Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed linter errors by renaming file to .tsx and adding React import
- Resolved JSX syntax recognition issues
- Confirmed successful build with npm run build

**Next Steps Ready:**
- OAuth provider configuration (Google, GitHub)
- Authentication UI components creation
- Route protection middleware implementation

**OAuth Provider Integration Completed:**

**OAuth Callback Route Handler** (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`):
- Handles OAuth code exchange for Google and GitHub
- Automatic user profile creation with metadata mapping
- Proper error handling and redirects
- Session establishment and validation

**OAuth Error Page** (`app/auth/error/page.tsx`):
- User-friendly error display with specific error messages
- Proper Suspense boundary for useSearchParams()
- Graceful fallback UI and navigation options
- Handles various OAuth error scenarios (access_denied, session_exchange_failed, etc.)

**Enhanced Supabase OAuth Configuration** (`lib/supabase.ts`):
- Structured OAuth provider definitions with scopes
- Enhanced auth config with PKCE security
- Helper functions for OAuth sign-in URLs
- Proper TypeScript types for OAuth providers

**Improved Authentication Hooks** (`hooks/use-auth.tsx`):
- Enhanced OAuth implementation with proper scopes
- Better error handling for OAuth flows
- Support for offline access and consent prompts
- Proper loading state management during redirects

**Build Verification**:
- All OAuth routes compile successfully
- No TypeScript or linting errors
- Proper Next.js App Router integration

**Technical Notes:**
- OAuth flows properly redirect to `/auth/callback`
- Error handling redirects to `/auth/error` with descriptive messages
- User metadata automatically mapped to profile fields
- Environment variables template includes required APP_URL

**TESTING RESULTS & MISSING SETUP IDENTIFIED:**

‚úÖ **What's Working:**
- Magic link authentication functional (but UI needs improvement)
- Dashboard displays user profile correctly
- Database schema and RLS policies in place
- Basic authentication flow established

‚ùå **Issues Found:**
- Google OAuth not working (missing Supabase OAuth provider configuration)
- Magic link uses browser prompt() instead of proper UI form
- No email/password signup option available
- GitHub integration not wanted by user

üîß **Missing Setup Requirements:**
- OAuth provider configuration in Supabase dashboard (Google client ID/secret)
- Proper email signup form with password requirements
- Improved magic link UI with styled input form
- Remove GitHub integration per user preference

**STATUS: Partial completion - core authentication works but user experience needs improvement**
