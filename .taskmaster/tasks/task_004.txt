# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Creator Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core creator management interface and backend logic.
# Details:
Implement a smart URL input field for creator addition. Use social-network-detector, feed-locator, rss-finder, and @extractus/feed-extractor for platform detection and RSS discovery. Support multi-URL per creator, real-time validation, and preview cards. Allow bulk import via CSV/OPML. Implement creator verification and status indicators. Use React hooks for state management and real-time feedback.

# Test Strategy:
Test URL validation, platform detection, and RSS discovery. Verify multi-URL support and bulk import. Check error handling and preview card display.
