# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Content Ingestion Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the automated content ingestion system for supported platforms.
# Details:
Set up Node.js-based ingestion services with queue management. Integrate YouTube Data API v3, Twitter API v2, RSS/Atom parsers, and Puppeteer for LinkedIn/Threads scraping. Implement rate limiting, error handling, and retry logic. Store content metadata in Supabase with processing status and error logs. Use Redis for caching and rate limiting.

# Test Strategy:
Test content fetching from all supported platforms. Verify rate limiting, error handling, and retry logic. Check content storage and deduplication.

# Subtasks:

## 4. Establish Asynchronous Queue Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Implement a robust queue system to manage asynchronous tasks for API calls, scraping, and feed parsing, supporting retries and prioritization.
### Details:
Choose a queue technology (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ), define task schemas, and set up workers to process tasks concurrently.

## 5. Integrate Rate Limiting Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Apply rate limiting to API integrations and scraping tasks to comply with external service policies and prevent throttling.
### Details:
Implement token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms, track request counts, and dynamically adjust task scheduling based on limits.

## 6. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Design error handling strategies for all integration points, including retries, backoff, and alerting for persistent failures.
### Details:
Standardize error formats, log errors with context, and provide mechanisms for manual intervention or escalation.

## 7. Design Metadata Storage Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create a schema and storage solution for persisting metadata from all sources, supporting efficient querying and updates.
### Details:
Select a database (SQL/NoSQL), define tables/collections for source, content, timestamps, and relationships between entities.

## 8. Implement Caching Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4, 5.7
### Description: Add a caching mechanism to reduce redundant API calls, scraping, and feed parsing, improving performance and reliability.
### Details:
Choose a caching technology (e.g., Redis, Memcached), define cache keys and expiration policies, and integrate with data retrieval logic.

## 9. YouTube Data API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate YouTube Data API v3 for video metadata and channel information
### Details:
Set up YouTube API credentials, implement channel data fetching, handle video metadata extraction, manage API quotas and rate limiting, implement error handling and retries. Before implementation, use Context7 MCP to get the latest documentation and best practices.

## 10. Twitter API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate Twitter API v2 for tweet fetching and user timeline access
### Details:
Set up Twitter API credentials, implement OAuth authentication, fetch user timelines and tweets, handle media content, manage API rate limits and pagination. Before implementation, use Context7 MCP to get the latest documentation and best practices.

## 11. API Response Normalization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Normalize API responses from different platforms into consistent data structures
### Details:
Create unified content models, standardize metadata fields, handle platform-specific data formats, implement content transformation pipelines

## 12. Puppeteer Environment Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Puppeteer headless browser environment for web scraping
### Details:
Configure Puppeteer with appropriate browser settings, implement proxy support, set up user agent rotation, configure resource optimization and memory management. Before implementation, use Context7 MCP to get the latest documentation and best practices.

## 13. LinkedIn Scraping Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement LinkedIn public post scraping with authentication handling
### Details:
Handle LinkedIn authentication, navigate post feeds, extract post content and metadata, implement anti-detection measures, handle dynamic content loading
