# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement AI-Powered Content Summarization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate LLM-based content summarization for long-form content.
# Details:
Use OpenAI or Anthropic API for summarization. Implement fallback to local models if needed. Cache summaries and version them for performance. Add summary quality scoring and feedback mechanisms. Use Supabase Edge Functions for serverless summarization endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Test summarization on sample content. Verify caching, versioning, and fallback logic. Check feedback and quality scoring.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate LLM API [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a robust integration with the primary LLM API, ensuring secure authentication, request/response handling, and error management.
### Details:
Implement API client logic, handle rate limits, and ensure compliance with provider requirements. Prepare for modular expansion to support additional models or providers. Before implementation, use Context7 MCP to get the latest documentation and best practices.

## 2. Implement Fallback Model Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop a fallback mechanism to automatically route requests to an alternative LLM or model when the primary API fails or underperforms.
### Details:
Design logic to detect failures or quality issues and trigger fallback. Ensure seamless switching and consistent output formatting between models.

## 3. Add Caching and Versioning Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Introduce a caching system to store and retrieve previous LLM responses, and implement versioning to manage model and API changes.
### Details:
Optimize for latency and cost by caching frequent queries. Track model versions and API changes to ensure reproducibility and traceability of outputs.

## 4. Integrate Quality Scoring Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Develop or integrate a module to automatically assess and score the quality of LLM outputs for each request.
### Details:
Use metrics such as ROUGE-L, BLEU, or custom heuristics to evaluate output quality. Feed scores into fallback logic and feedback mechanisms.

## 5. Implement Feedback Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Create a system for collecting user or automated feedback on LLM responses to inform continuous improvement and retraining.
### Details:
Enable users or automated agents to rate, comment, or flag outputs. Store feedback for analysis and use it to refine quality scoring and fallback strategies.
