# Task ID: 7
# Title: Build Dashboard Feed Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the main content feed and filtering interface.
# Details:
Create a chronological feed with infinite scroll and real-time updates via WebSocket. Implement mobile-responsive design with touch-friendly interactions. Use React Query for data fetching and state management. Optimize for performance with skeleton loading and image optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Test feed loading, infinite scroll, and real-time updates. Verify mobile responsiveness and touch interactions. Check performance metrics.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Feed UI Layout with Mobile Responsiveness [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational feed interface, ensuring it adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices for optimal mobile responsiveness.
### Details:
Use responsive CSS frameworks or media queries to ensure the feed layout works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Prioritize touch-friendly interactions and test across common device breakpoints.

## 2. Implement Infinite Scroll Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Integrate infinite scrolling to dynamically load more feed items as the user scrolls, enhancing user experience and reducing initial load times.
### Details:
Utilize React hooks and libraries such as Intersection Observer or custom scroll event handlers. Ensure smooth loading of additional content and consider adding a 'scroll to top' button for usability.[1][3]

## 3. Integrate React Query for Data Fetching and Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Set up React Query to manage server-side data fetching, caching, and pagination for the feed, supporting infinite scroll requirements.
### Details:
Use React Query's useInfiniteQuery hook to handle paginated data fetching, background refetching, and cache management for efficient and scalable data handling.[2][4] Before implementation, use Context7 MCP to get the latest documentation and best practices.

## 4. Add WebSocket Real-Time Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Enable real-time updates in the feed by integrating WebSocket connections, allowing new items or changes to appear instantly.
### Details:
Establish a WebSocket connection to listen for updates from the server. Merge incoming real-time data into the existing feed, ensuring consistency with React Query's cache.

## 5. Optimize Feed Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Apply performance optimizations to ensure smooth scrolling, fast rendering, and efficient resource usage, especially with large datasets.
### Details:
Implement techniques such as virtualization (e.g., react-window), memoization, and selective rendering. Monitor and minimize unnecessary re-renders and memory usage.[3]

## 6. Develop Comprehensive Testing Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Create and execute tests covering UI responsiveness, infinite scroll, real-time updates, and performance to ensure reliability and maintainability.
### Details:
Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using tools like Jest and React Testing Library. Test edge cases such as rapid scrolling, network failures, and real-time data races.

## 7. Virtual Scrolling Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement virtual scrolling for performance optimization with large datasets
### Details:
Set up virtual scrolling library, implement viewport management, handle dynamic item heights, optimize rendering performance for thousands of items

## 8. Pagination and Data Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement pagination logic and progressive data loading for infinite scroll
### Details:
Implement cursor-based pagination, handle loading states, implement scroll position persistence, optimize data fetching and caching

## 9. WebSocket Connection Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement WebSocket connection management with reconnection logic
### Details:
Set up WebSocket connections, implement connection health monitoring, handle reconnection on failures, implement heartbeat and keep-alive mechanisms
