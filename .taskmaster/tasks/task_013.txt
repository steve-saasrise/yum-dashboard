# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Rate Limiting and Usage Controls
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop rate limiting and usage control mechanisms.
# Details:
Set creator addition limits (10/day/user for free tier). Implement API usage tracking and quota management. Add anti-abuse mechanisms for content scraping. Build usage analytics and reporting dashboard. Use Redis for rate limiting and Supabase for analytics.

# Test Strategy:
Test rate limiting and quota enforcement. Verify anti-abuse and analytics reporting.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Creator Addition Limits [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement limits on creator additions to prevent abuse.
### Details:
Develop a system to track and limit the number of creators that can be added within a certain timeframe.

## 2. API Usage Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Monitor and track API usage to enforce rate limits.
### Details:
Set up a system to monitor API requests and track usage patterns.

## 3. Anti-Abuse Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Develop mechanisms to prevent API abuse, such as rate limiting algorithms.
### Details:
Implement algorithms like fixed window, sliding window, or token bucket to prevent abuse.

## 4. Analytics Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Create a dashboard to visualize API usage and abuse trends.
### Details:
Design a dashboard to display API usage patterns, rate limit hits, and abuse attempts.

## 5. Redis Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Integrate Redis for distributed rate limiting and data storage.
### Details:
Use Redis to store and manage rate limit counters across distributed systems. Before implementation, use Context7 MCP to get the latest documentation and best practices.
