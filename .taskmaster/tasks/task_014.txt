# Task ID: 14
# Title: Optimize Performance and Cross-Browser Compatibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize platform performance and ensure cross-browser compatibility.
# Details:
Optimize initial page load (<2s), critical rendering path, and JavaScript bundles. Use CDN for images and static assets. Implement responsive design and accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA). Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, iOS, and Android. Use Lighthouse and browser dev tools for profiling.

# Test Strategy:
Test page load times and rendering performance. Verify cross-browser functionality and accessibility. Use Lighthouse for audits.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Page Load Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement best practices to reduce page load time, including minimizing HTTP requests, compressing assets, and using lazy loading for images.
### Details:
Review and minimize external scripts, compress images, enable lazy loading, and use priority hints for critical assets[1][3][4].

## 2. Critical Rendering Path Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Optimize the sequence of steps the browser takes to render the page by reducing file sizes, loading important content first, and using asynchronous loading for non-critical scripts.
### Details:
Reduce CSS/JS file sizes, inline critical CSS, defer non-critical JS, and batch DOM updates to minimize layout events[2][4].

## 3. CDN Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Configure a Content Delivery Network to distribute website assets globally, reducing latency and improving load times for users in different regions.
### Details:
Select a CDN provider, configure asset delivery, and ensure proper caching headers are set for static resources[3][4][5].

## 4. Responsive Design Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Ensure the website layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, improving user experience and accessibility.
### Details:
Use media queries, flexible grids, and responsive images; test on multiple device sizes and orientations[3][5].

## 5. Cross-Browser Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Test the website across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent performance and appearance.
### Details:
Use automated and manual testing tools to verify compatibility and performance on major browsers and devices[5].
