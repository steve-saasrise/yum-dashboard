# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Security and Compliance Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop security and compliance features for data protection and authentication.
# Details:
Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data. Ensure GDPR compliance with data export/deletion. Add multi-factor authentication and secure session management. Implement XSS protection, domain whitelist/blacklist, and URL sanitization. Use Content Security Policy headers. Conduct regular security audits.

# Test Strategy:
Test encryption, GDPR features, and MFA. Verify XSS protection and URL sanitization. Check security headers and audit logs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Encryption Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement data encryption using best practices such as AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for communications.
### Details:
Ensure proper key management and consider post-quantum cryptography for future-proofing.

## 2. GDPR Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure compliance with GDPR regulations by implementing data protection policies and procedures.
### Details:
Conduct a GDPR readiness assessment and implement necessary controls.

## 3. Multi-Factor Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement multi-factor authentication to enhance user login security.
### Details:
Use a combination of methods such as passwords, biometrics, and one-time passwords.

## 4. XSS Protection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by validating user input and using output encoding.
### Details:
Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to define allowed sources of content.

## 5. CSP Headers Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to define allowed sources of content.
### Details:
Configure CSP to restrict scripts and styles to specific domains.

## 6. Security Audits [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5
### Description: Conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with implemented security measures.
### Details:
Perform audits on encryption, GDPR compliance, MFA, XSS protection, and CSP headers.

## 7. Data-at-Rest Encryption [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement encryption for sensitive data stored in the database
### Details:
Set up database encryption keys, implement field-level encryption for sensitive data, configure encrypted backups, implement key rotation policies. Before implementation, use Context7 MCP for documentation research and Supabase MCP for database/auth setup.

## 8. Data-in-Transit Encryption [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement TLS/SSL encryption for all data transmissions
### Details:
Configure TLS 1.3 for all connections, implement certificate management, set up HSTS headers, configure secure API endpoints. Before implementation, use Context7 MCP to get the latest documentation and best practices.

## 9. Key Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement secure key management and rotation system
### Details:
Set up key management service, implement key rotation schedules, configure key access controls, implement key backup and recovery

## 10. Data Access and Portability [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement GDPR-compliant data access and portability features
### Details:
Create data export functionality, implement data access requests, ensure machine-readable formats, implement data verification and integrity checks. Before implementation, use Supabase MCP to check project configuration and apply necessary setup.

## 11. Right to Erasure Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement complete data deletion and right to be forgotten functionality
### Details:
Create data deletion workflows, implement cascading deletions, handle data anonymization, implement deletion verification and audit trails

## 12. Consent Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive consent management for data processing
### Details:
Create consent forms and tracking, implement granular consent options, handle consent withdrawal, implement consent audit logging

## 13. CSRF Protection Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement CSRF protection for all authentication forms to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks
### Details:
Create comprehensive CSRF protection system:
1. Create server-side CSRF token generation/validation using crypto.randomUUID()
2. Add CSRF tokens to login, signup, forgot-password, and magic-link forms
3. Validate CSRF tokens in API routes before processing requests
4. Use secure HTTP-only cookies for token storage with SameSite=strict
5. Implement proper error handling for invalid/missing CSRF tokens
6. Add cleanup for expired tokens
7. Test all authentication flows with CSRF protection enabled

Focus on: app/auth/login/page.tsx, app/auth/signup/page.tsx, app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx, app/api/auth/magic-link/route.ts

Security Requirements:
- CSRF tokens must be unique per session
- Tokens must expire after reasonable time (1 hour)
- All authentication forms must include CSRF validation
- API endpoints must validate tokens before processing
- Proper error messages for CSRF failures without information leakage
