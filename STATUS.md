## üîÑ Development Session Guidelines

### Starting a Session

1. Read this STATUS.md file to understand current priorities
2. **CRITICAL**: Before working on any task, verify all preceding tasks are actually complete
   - Check if previous tasks marked as complete are truly finished
   - Verify implementation exists and is working
   - Test functionality if in doubt
   - Mark incomplete tasks as `[ ]` if they need completion
3. Check `/docs/phase2/` for detailed feature specifications
4. Review recent git commits for context
5. Identify the specific task to work on
6. **IMPORTANT**: Use only `mcp__supabase-saasrise__*` tools (never `mcp__supabase-mine`)

### During Development

- Update this file when starting major features
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Test features thoroughly before marking complete
- Document any architectural decisions

### Ending a Session

1. **MANDATORY**: Test all implemented functionality thoroughly
2. **MANDATORY**: Update task status in this file ONLY after complete testing
3. Mark tasks as `[x]` ONLY when:
   - Implementation is complete
   - All tests pass
   - Feature works as expected
   - No critical bugs remain
4. Commit all changes with summary message
5. Note any blockers or decisions needed
6. Update next steps if priorities changed

### Task Status Management

- **`[x]` = Complete**: Feature fully implemented, tested, and working
- **`[ ]` = Incomplete**: Feature not yet implemented or has issues
- **`üéØ` = In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **‚ö†Ô∏è = Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues
