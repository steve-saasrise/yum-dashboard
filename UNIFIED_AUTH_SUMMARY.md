# Unified Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated from dual authentication system (curator auth + Supabase auth) to a unified Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system using only Supabase Auth.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migrations Applied ✅

- **Role Column Migration**: Added `role` column to users table with values: 'viewer', 'curator', 'admin'
- **RLS Policies Update**: Updated all Row Level Security policies to respect user roles
- **Current Status**: steve@saasrise.com already has admin role

### 2. Removed Curator Authentication System ✅

- Deleted `/app/curator/*` pages (login, invite-signup, etc.)
- Deleted `/app/api/curator/*` API endpoints
- Removed `use-curator-auth.tsx` hook
- Removed curator invite service
- Updated middleware to redirect curator routes to regular auth

### 3. Updated Admin Dashboard ✅

- Changed from curator invite management to user role management
- Added role selection dropdown for each user
- Added stats cards showing user counts by role
- Admins can now change any user's role (except removing their own admin privileges)

### 4. Authentication Flow

```
User Login → Supabase Auth → Check User Role → Grant Access Based on Role
```

### 5. Role Permissions

- **Viewer** (default): Can view content, lounges, and creators
- **Curator**: Can create/edit lounges and creators, manage content
- **Admin**: Full access including user role management

## Testing the New System

### 1. Login as Admin

- Email: steve@saasrise.com
- You already have admin role

### 2. Access Admin Dashboard

- Navigate to `/dashboard/admin`
- You should see the user management interface
- You can change other users' roles

### 3. Test Role-Based Features

- **As Admin**: Full access to everything
- **As Curator**: Can create lounges and creators
- **As Viewer**: Read-only access

### 4. Verify Authentication

```bash
# Run the test script
npm run tsx scripts/test-unified-auth.ts
```

## Next Steps

1. Test creating lounges and creators with different role levels
2. Verify RLS policies are working correctly
3. Consider adding role indicators in the UI
4. Update any documentation referencing curator auth

## Technical Details

- All API routes now use unified auth via `createBrowserSupabaseClient()`
- RLS policies check user role from users table
- No more cookie-based curator sessions
- Single sign-on experience for all users
