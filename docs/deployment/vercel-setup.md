# Vercel Deployment Setup

## Environment Variables

When deploying to Vercel, you need to set the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

### Required Variables

1. **NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL**
   - Your Supabase project URL
   - Example: `https://your-project.supabase.co`

2. **NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY**
   - Your Supabase anonymous key (safe for browser)
   - Found in Supabase project settings

3. **UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL**
   - Your Upstash Redis REST URL
   - Example: `https://your-redis.upstash.io`

4. **UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN**
   - Your Upstash Redis REST token
   - Found in Upstash console

5. **CRON_SECRET**
   - A secure random string to protect cron endpoints
   - Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - **Important**: This must match the value in your Vercel environment

### Optional Variables (for future features)

- **YOUTUBE_API_KEY** - For YouTube content fetching
- **TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN** - For Twitter content fetching

## Setting Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add each variable with its value
4. Make sure to select the appropriate environments (Production, Preview, Development)

## Cron Job Configuration

The automated content fetching is configured in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/fetch-content",
      "schedule": "0 */30 * * *" // Runs every 30 minutes
    }
  ]
}
```

### Testing Cron Jobs Locally

To test the cron endpoint locally:

```bash
# Without authentication (works in development)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/fetch-content

# With authentication (mimics production)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/fetch-content \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secure-cron-secret-here"
```

### Monitoring Cron Jobs

1. Check Vercel Functions logs for execution history
2. The endpoint returns statistics about content fetched
3. Failed fetches are logged but don't stop the process

## Security Notes

- The `CRON_SECRET` prevents unauthorized access to your cron endpoints
- In development, the cron endpoint works without authentication for testing
- In production (when `VERCEL` env var is set), authentication is required
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
