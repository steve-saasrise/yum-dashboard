# Multiple URL Support for Creators

## Overview

**User Story (ST-202):** As a user, I want to add multiple URLs for the same creator so that I can follow their content across different platforms.

## Feature Description

The Multiple URL Support feature allows users to associate multiple social media accounts and content sources with a single creator profile. This enables comprehensive content tracking across platforms for creators who maintain presence on multiple services.

## User Experience Design

### Core Functionality

1. **"Add another URL" Button**
   - Prominently displayed in the creator management modal
   - Allows users to add additional URLs to the same creator
   - Dynamically adds new URL input fields without page refresh

2. **URL Cards Display**
   - Each URL displays as a separate visual card
   - Shows platform icon and real-time validation status
   - Displays platform-specific branding for clear identification
   - Individual removal and editing capabilities per URL

3. **Platform Management Interface**
   - Visual cards for each connected platform
   - Last validation date and health status indicators
   - Platform-specific icons (YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Threads, RSS)
   - Status indicators: Valid, Invalid, Pending validation

### User Workflow

1. User opens "Add New Creator" or "Edit Creator" modal
2. Enters primary URL using Smart URL Input component
3. Clicks "Add another URL" button to add additional platforms
4. Each URL is validated in real-time with platform detection
5. User can remove individual URLs without affecting others
6. Duplicate URL detection prevents adding the same URL twice
7. Save creator with all associated URLs

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema (‚úÖ Complete)

The feature is built on the existing `creator_urls` table:

```sql
creator_urls:
- id (PK): UUID
- creator_id (FK): UUID, references Creators(id)
- platform: ENUM('youtube', 'twitter', 'linkedin', 'threads', 'website')
- url: VARCHAR(255), not null
- normalized_url: VARCHAR(255), not null
- validation_status: ENUM('valid', 'invalid', 'pending')
- last_validated: TIMESTAMP
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
- updated_at: TIMESTAMP
```

### API Endpoints (‚úÖ Complete)

The following API endpoints support multiple URL management:

- `POST /api/creators` - Creates creator with multiple URLs
- `PUT /api/creators/[id]` - Updates creator and associated URLs
- `DELETE /api/creators/[id]` - Removes creator and all URLs
- Individual URL management through creator_urls relationship

### Platform Detection Integration

- Leverages existing Platform Detection Service (95% test coverage)
- Real-time URL validation and normalization
- Automatic platform identification from URLs
- Metadata extraction (usernames, channel IDs, handles)

## Current Status

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ISSUE - UI Layer Broken**

**Problem:** The multiple URL functionality was previously working but is currently broken due to UI component regression.

**Root Cause:**

- Database schema ‚úÖ supports multiple URLs
- API endpoints ‚úÖ handle multiple URLs correctly
- Platform detection ‚úÖ working at 95% coverage
- **UI components** ‚ùå broken - form submission not handling multiple URLs

**Symptoms:**

- Creator modal form only accepts single URL
- "Add another URL" button missing or non-functional
- URL cards not displaying properly
- Form submission not persisting multiple URLs

### Implementation Priority

**Status:** üî• **Critical Priority 1** - Must fix before continuing with other features

**Required Actions:**

1. Debug creator modal form component
2. Restore "Add another URL" button functionality
3. Fix URL cards display and management
4. Test multiple URL submission and persistence
5. Verify individual URL removal works correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Requirements

- [ ] ‚úÖ "Add another URL" button allows multiple URLs per creator
- [ ] ‚úÖ Each URL displays as a separate card with platform icon and validation status
- [ ] ‚úÖ Users can remove individual URLs without affecting other URLs for the same creator
- [ ] ‚úÖ Duplicate URL detection prevents adding the same URL twice
- [ ] ‚úÖ URL cards show last validation date and health status
- [ ] ‚úÖ Platform-specific icons clearly identify each connected service

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] ‚úÖ Real-time platform detection for each URL
- [ ] ‚úÖ URL normalization and validation
- [ ] ‚úÖ Proper error handling for invalid URLs
- [ ] ‚úÖ Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [ ] ‚úÖ Accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Performance Requirements

- [ ] ‚úÖ Debounced URL validation (300ms delay)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Efficient database queries for creator URLs
- [ ] ‚úÖ Optimistic UI updates for URL management

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- URL validation and normalization
- Platform detection accuracy
- Database operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Error handling for edge cases

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end creator creation with multiple URLs
- URL management workflows (add, edit, remove)
- API endpoint validation
- Database constraint enforcement

### E2E Tests

- Complete user workflow testing
- Cross-platform URL management
- Form validation and submission
- Error state handling

## Dependencies

### Completed Infrastructure

- ‚úÖ Platform Detection Service (`lib/platform-detector.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Smart URL Input Component (`components/ui/smart-url-input.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Database schema and migrations
- ‚úÖ API endpoints for CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage

### Blocked Until Fixed

- Creator Management UI restoration
- End-to-end testing completion
- Content ingestion pipeline (depends on working creator management)
