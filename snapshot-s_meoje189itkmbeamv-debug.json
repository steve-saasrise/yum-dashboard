    "post_text": "This is the latest in a series of questions posed to me by Microsoft CoPilot when asked What are some of the most profound and complex questions philosophers grapple with? By Geoffrey Moore Author – The Infinite Staircase: What the Universe Tells Us About Life, Ethics, and Mortality This question is an artifact of religious worldviews that are anchored in an omniscient and omnipotent divine creator who is all good, raising the question of how then can evil even exist? Theodicy represents an entire corpus of commentary devoted to answering that question, of which Google gives the following brief summary: Theodicy is the attempt to reconcile the existence of evil with the belief in a benevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient God. It explores why, if God is all-good and all-powerful, evil exists in the world. Theodicy is not about proving God's existence, but rather explaining how God's attributes are compatible with the presence of suffering and evil. The explanations are several, and personally, I have never found any of them satisfying. There is a very different road to take, on the other hand, if we adopt a secular worldview, and that is what I want to explore here. In The Infinite Staircase , there is a chapter on understanding goodness that calls out three very different meanings we might have in mind. One is anchored in pleasure (“feels good”), another in efficacy (“works good”), and a third in morality (“is good”). Each dimension emerges on a different stair, as follows: Feels good emerges on the stair of Desire and represents desire fulfilled. An organism does not even need to be conscious to pursue this outcome, as the behavior of plants bears witness. Works good emerges on the stair of Consciousness and represents tactics that are useful to survival or wellbeing. These are amoral by nature, meaning there can be such a thing as a good bomb as well as a good pair of scissors. Is good emerges on the stair of Values and represents thoughts and actions that are of benefit to others. This is the domain of morality, and the one that is directly relevant to the question at hand. Subsequent stairs can then act on morality, with Culture promulgating it, Language explicating it, Narrative evangelizing it, Analytics dissecting it, and Theory classifying it. Kant’s categorical imperative is a good example of a theory of morality. Now, if the essence of moral goodness is contributing to the benefit of others, where does evil fit in? If we define evil as the opposite of good, which seems reasonable, then it represents actions or thoughts that contribute to the harm of others. It emerges on the stair of Consciousness, typically driven by thwarted attempts to fulfill Desire. Through consciousness, evil secures its power by learning amoral “good tricks,” behaviors that succeed for the actor even as they cause harm to others. Thus, morality, in a secular context, is essentially social . Good is altruistic, and evil is selfish. Because both are defined socially, both are mammalian in evolutionary heritage. Snakes and spiders, by contrast, do not develop socially, and that is why we use them as symbols of evil, unfair as that may be to them. So, to answer the question as posed, yes, good can exist without evil just as evil can exist without good. They are not connected in essence, only relative to their impact on others. This begs another question, however, one that lurks between the one posed: Can good defeat evil? I think the answer to that question is no, if what one means by defeat is eradication. The best good can do is isolate and contain evil doing, ideally buying time to investigate and ameliorate the thwarted desire that is driving the behavior. When good sets out to destroy evil, it just ends up amplifying it with its own harmful efforts. That’s what I think. What do you think?
