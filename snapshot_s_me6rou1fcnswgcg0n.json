    "post_text": "I'm not a big fan of dwelling without action. I've got a very basic thesis: if I find myself in a situation where I'm unhappy, either I do something about it, or—if I've decided I don't want to do something about it—I keep my mouth shut, because there's too much energy wasted on dwelling. It's pretty simple, my friends: complaining gets you nowhere. If you're super unhappy—if you wake up every morning dreading going to work—you have several options. You can, while you still have that job, start something else on the side and let it build... or you can quit and start something new right away... or you can stay the course and have regret when you're older... or figure out how to get your joy elsewhere. That's it. That's the game. You’ve got options—you just need to take action. Dwelling and talking about it does nothing. If this hits for you, let's use this post to inspire you to address that sh*t once and for all. Who’s in?",

    "post_text": "If you think about music, sports, movies, TV, and fashion, those categories are now essential parts of life. We go out over dinner and very quickly after catching up on work and family, conversation generally switches to one of these topics. What I've realized is that collecting is on the precipice, within the next decade or two, of being a huge genre. I believe in 15 to 20 years, when you go out to dinner with friends or meet someone at a business meeting and go out for drinks afterwards, you will sit down and ask each other, \"what are you collecting?\" Between art, watches, sneakers, handbags, trading cards, and more, collectibles will be here for the rest of our lives. When you add digital collectibles into the conversation, it's a no-brainer. Why? Because collecting is entrenched in the fabric of the DNA of a human being. It's just what we do. We're tribal, we're animals, we're hoarders. I'm passionate about collecting in general, but if you're debating on build your own IP or collectible business, this is for you.. Watch this space, it's only getting bigger and bigger.",

        "comment": "Over the last year, I’ve been dipping my toe into the Pokémon card market — and the returns have been nothing short of ridiculous. The demand is insane. Every major big-box store — Walmart, Target, you name it — can’t keep product on shelves. Some locations are selling well above MSRP the moment new sets drop. It’s not just collectors either. There are paid Discord groups, live events, trade shows, tournaments, and an active secondary market for both sealed and opened cards. I’ve seen individual flips and sealed box sales hit numbers that would make traditional investors double-take. But here’s the real story: it’s not just about cardboard. It’s about community. People aren’t just buying — they’re connecting, trading, playing, and building something bigger than the product itself. And I think that’s the key to where business is headed across every industry. The winners will be the ones who can create a community, not just a customer base. Whether it’s trading cards, niche hobbies, or mainstream brands — the future belongs to those who make people feel like they’re part of something.",

    "post_text": "If you're not \"feeling it\" ... if you're not content with where you are in your life, your career, your business, it might be time to find new friends. I'm being dead serious about this. Who you hang out with is a huge deal. We've all heard the saying: \"You're the average of the five friends you spend the most time with.\" I'm here to tell you, that's real. That one, you can put in the bank. It's unbelievable what happened to me when I got into the Silicon Valley world and started meeting people like Mark Zuckerberg, Ev Williams, Travis Kalanick, etc.—it changed my life. Actually, it's a fun story: SXSW 2007 changed my life because I hung out with different people. I forced myself to go to a Web 2.0, which later became Social Media \"The Current State of the Internet\" Conference. By the way, this is when tech wasn't \"cool,\" but these guys were trying to change sh*t. They weren't here for kicks and giggles. They were here to change the world 🌎 like, I'm going to build a product that is going to be in every single person's hand—and they have. The Twitters, the Facebooks, the Ubers—they did it—and it was the biggest impact in my career. If you feel motivated by this conversation or you're intrigued by it at all, start with adding one new winner friend to your circle ... and cut or limit time with the friend that's not pushing you further. Go somewhere that hosts meetups, find an app, go to a networking event, attend a conference... DM the people that you think are doing what you want and make one new friend. Just one. It's real. Confidence and hunger get passed on from one person to another. It's like team dynamics in sports—it's why one player can mess up an entire team. Ask yourself, is it time to audit your circle?",

Few of us have the opportunity to collaborate with highly influential people like Mark Zuckerberg and other entrepreneurs, but many can collaborate with people at and above their level, and be just as successful as you are. I do agree confident people will more easily exchange ideas with others. All of us want to spend time with upbeat, positive people who lift us up rather than tear us down. At times, though, we will meet people that just need to see the other side, collaborate, and contribute a while to make positive changes in themselves, and embrace the comfort they feel. They will be surprised at the natural creativity and substance they bring to any conversation. Success is not only measured by lifting yourself, but also lifting others who are somewhat hesitant to believe in themselves until another, who sensed something, gave them a chance. There are varying degrees and kinds of success. Great Leaders encourage growth in all their team members.",

I&apos;m being dead serious about this.<br/><br/>Who you hang out with is a huge deal.<br/><br/>We&apos;ve all heard the saying: &quot;You&apos;re the average of the five friends you spend the most time with.&quot; I&apos;m here to tell you, that&apos;s real. That one, you can put in the bank.<br/><br/>It&apos;s unbelievable what happened to me when I got into the Silicon Valley world and started meeting people like Mark Zuckerberg, Ev Williams, Travis Kalanick, etc.&#x2014;it changed my life. Actually, it&apos;s a fun story:<br/><br/>SXSW 2007 changed my life because I hung out with different people. I forced myself to go to a Web 2.0, which later became Social Media &quot;The Current State of the Internet&quot; Conference. By the way, this is when tech wasn&apos;t &quot;cool,&quot; but these guys were trying to change sh*t. They weren&apos;t here for kicks and giggles. They were here to change the world &#x1F30E; like, I&apos;m going to build a product that is going to be in every single person&apos;s hand&#x2014;and they have. The Twitters, the Facebooks, the Ubers&#x2014;they did it&#x2014;and it was the biggest impact in my career.<br/><br/>If you feel motivated by this conversation or you&apos;re intrigued by it at all, start with adding one new winner friend to your circle ... and cut or limit time with the friend that&apos;s not pushing you further.<br/><br/>Go somewhere that hosts meetups, find an app, go to a networking event, attend a conference... DM the people that you think are doing what you want and make one new friend. Just one.<br/><br/>It&apos;s real. Confidence and hunger get passed on from one person to another. It&apos;s like team dynamics in sports&#x2014;it&apos;s why one player can mess up an entire team.<br/><br/>Ask yourself, is it time to audit your circle?",

Everyone wants to \"get rich quick.\" People ask for big things... to be known, to get compensated for being themselves, to sell books, to speak. They want these things but they want it to come quickly. The truth is, it should be hard... because 99% of the world works for someone else. The second you want something fast is the second I'll show you something that's vulnerable: a relationship, a business, growth on a platform... Speed is the enemy to so many right now. Do I think there are many unlimited opportunities in the world? Yes, I do. But once you allow the word \"easy\" to come into your head when you're building something, it's game over. It's hard for people to accept the amount of hours it takes to build something meaningful, but if you're looking for something special to happen, it's supposed to be hard.",

You’re capable, but if you spend all your time worrying about the 80,000 people or businesses you could be competing with, that’s spending no time on winning. I came into the agency industry 15 years ago. Nobody was buying into social media yet and I was from the wine retail world. I was literally “the wine guy.” When I said, “hey, use my agency,” people would ask me, “what did you do before?” When I said I sold wine, they laughed! And I built the largest independent agency in the world. You’re capable. Spend zero minutes about the competition. Zero. If you’re good enough, no one is stopping you.",

    "post_text": "Too many people out there are taking dollars off the table and not reinvesting them back into their companies. This is one of the biggest mistakes young entrepreneurs make. I'm seeing a huge trend: a lot of young people are building something, but then taking the profits and pouring them into “stuff.” They’re trying to feed themselves, their egos, their insecurities. They’re buying dumb sh*t. They’re trying to flex. I really wish I could communicate how much I feel that’s leaving a massive opportunity on the table. Reinvesting in your business instead of your short-term desires is something you have to consider. What are you going to do with that extra money you put in your pocket? Nothing productive, I promise. That doesn’t mean don’t enjoy the fruits of your labor—and of course, make sure you get what you need—but please remember: feeding your business often feeds you more in the end. When I was 28 years old, I was making $37K a year. Why? Because I was investing. Because Wine Library was my asset. And so, if you keep compounding and putting your dollars back into the business—grow, grow, grow instead of take, take, take—you’ll win. This isn’t about having a business just so you can live off of it. This is about feeding a business so you can live in happiness, in perpetuity. Business owners, please chime in with your thoughts in the comments!",

This is one of the biggest mistakes young entrepreneurs make.<br/><br/>I&apos;m seeing a huge trend: a lot of young people are building something, but then taking the profits and pouring them into &#x201C;stuff.&#x201D; They&#x2019;re trying to feed themselves, their egos, their insecurities. They&#x2019;re buying dumb sh*t. They&#x2019;re trying to flex. I really wish I could communicate how much I feel that&#x2019;s leaving a massive opportunity on the table.<br/><br/>Reinvesting in your business instead of your short-term desires is something you have to consider. What are you going to do with that extra money you put in your pocket? Nothing productive, I promise. That doesn&#x2019;t mean don&#x2019;t enjoy the fruits of your labor&#x2014;and of course, make sure you get what you need&#x2014;but please remember: feeding your business often feeds you more in the end.<br/><br/>When I was 28 years old, I was making $37K a year. Why? Because I was investing. Because Wine Library was my asset.<br/><br/>And so, if you keep compounding and putting your dollars back into the business&#x2014;grow, grow, grow instead of take, take, take&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll win. This isn&#x2019;t about having a business just so you can live off of it. This is about feeding a business so you can live in happiness, in perpetuity.<br/><br/>Business owners, please chime in with your thoughts in the comments!",

    "post_text": "At 28 year old I was in the basement of a liquor store packing wine in a box to ship. That’s what I was doing for my career, packing wine, shipping it out. I was the help. I was in a warehouse. The fact that people actually think at 18, 22 or 30 you hace to have your shit figured out is ridiculous. Let me promise you, all those parents and uncles and grandparents that pushed down your throat, that you have to figure it out by now, they still haven’t figured it the fuck out. So many people in their 30s think they're \"lost\" in life... You're not lost, you're just early in the process! I started VaynerMedia at 34 years old in someone else's conference room, because we had no money for rent. It was a ton of risk by normal standards when somebody reads it on paper. But for me, it just felt like progression. Society puts a lot of pressure on people in their 20s and 30s to “figure out” their lives without understanding how long life really is. Many young people today will end up living beyond 100 years old — with most of those years being good, healthy years. That means if you’re under 30, you’ve got about 60-70 more years of execution left. There are challenges of course - but it's super normal to grow and evolve over time at your own pace. What you'll want at 22 isn't always what you'll want at 30 or 45. Try to get to a place of success (aka happiness) but don't ever judge yourself for where you're at ❤️",

Some folks take their time designing the perfect blueprint, while others are out there building skyscrapers made of trial and error. And guess what? It's all valid.

I was in a warehouse. <br/><br/>The fact that people actually think at 18, 22 or 30 you hace to have your shit figured out is ridiculous. <br/><br/>Let me promise you, all those parents and uncles and grandparents that pushed down your throat, that you have to figure it out by now, they still haven&#x2019;t figured it the fuck out. <br/><br/>So many people in their 30s think they&apos;re &quot;lost&quot; in life... <br/><br/>You&apos;re not lost, you&apos;re just early in the process!<br/><br/>I started VaynerMedia at 34 years old in someone else&apos;s conference room, because we had no money for rent.<br/><br/>It was a ton of risk by normal standards when somebody reads it on paper.<br/><br/>But for me, it just felt like progression.<br/><br/>Society puts a lot of pressure on people in their 20s and 30s to &#x201C;figure out&#x201D; their lives without understanding how long life really is.<br/><br/>Many young people today will end up living beyond 100 years old &#x2014; with most of those years being good, healthy years.<br/><br/>That means if you&#x2019;re under 30, you&#x2019;ve got about 60-70 more years of execution left.<br/><br/>There are challenges of course - but it&apos;s super normal to grow and evolve over time at your own pace. <br/><br/>What you&apos;ll want at 22 isn&apos;t always what you&apos;ll want at 30 or 45.<br/><br/>Try to get to a place of success (aka happiness) but don&apos;t ever judge yourself for where you&apos;re at &#x2764;&#xFE0F;",

    "post_text": "If every 49-year-old knew how true this was, the world would be a much happier place. This isn't delusion or optimism... based on how long people are living and how vibrant 60-, 70-, and 80-year-olds are, 49 is young! We didn’t think that when we were 18, but it’s true. I’m just unbelievably fascinated by people’s inability to have perspective on time ⏱️. 18- and 22-year-olds are being told to “figure out” their lives, and it’s just the silliest thing. There’s so much pressure in our culture, so many opinions, but the truth is, it’s not being talked about enough that if you’re 40, 50, 60 years old—it’s not over. If you want it badly, if it’s in you, maybe it’s not time to take up golf or “pack it in.” Maybe it’s time to actually triple down. So many feel like life is a young man’s sport, and it’s just not. So stop making excuses. Nobody cares if you’re 40, 50, 60... the market will accept your victories if you’re good enough to have a victory. I believe if you’re 49 years old—because of the phone, because of social media, because of live social shopping, because of AI—you’ve got more opportunities than ever to create something for yourself. You have real experience, you have context, you have knowledge—start deploying that. Educate yourself on the new world and get to work. Please, my friends, do not allow just the 18- and 22-year-olds to grab at this pie that is so available to all of us, regardless of our age. We’re gonna live longer. The opportunity is real. LinkedIn, if you’re reading this right now and you’re 40–50 years old, realize that you actually have an unbelievable amount of time to start over. You literally have 50 f*cking more years. What are you going to do with them?",

Especially for those in leadership positions—so many of you are doing better than you think. If you're a provider, financially or emotionally, you have to protect yourself first. Because if you're doing for everyone else and not yourself, you're going to eventually break—and the whole thing's going to fall apart. Remember, the only way to be selfless is to start by being selfish. So use today to be kind to yourself. So much love to everyone who’s trying. ❤️",

That was the only time I was pumped professionally and financially–when I broke the $100K-in-a-year barrier. No other time. When that number for the masses moved from $100K to $1M, things got ugly… and I know why people think it’s easy. In the ‘80s, there was Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. In the ‘90s, there was MTV Cribs. Now, 24/7, people are looking at propaganda in their feeds of watches, cars, and vacations and they want to live that life. I keep hearing everyone wanting to blame Instagram and social media, but I say: stop consuming it. Stop consuming it, stop chasing it, stop putting it on a pedestal. The definition of success is not to make $1M. It’s to actually wake up in the morning and be in a good mood. The one thing I desperately want for you–more than money, attention, and fame–is the feeling you get when you are able to do what you love, day in and day out. Because when you truly love it, you’ll want to work for it. THAT'S true success.",

    "post_text": "When I was younger, I used to think that 50 year olds were ancient. But now that I'm 49, I realize that age is just a number. I feel young in my soul and that has been a key factor in my success. To all you young people out there - the 13, 16, 19, and 24 year olds - I wish you could feel how young I am in my soul right now. It would change everything you do. You'd become dramatically more patient and that would help you achieve the success you want in life. I know a lot of you are looking for shortcuts and instant gratification. But let me tell you, patience is the foundation of success. It's not about being complacent or lacking ambition. It's about staying committed to your goals and being willing to put in the time and effort it takes to achieve them. I didn't even start building my own brand until I was 34. For the first 12 years of my career, I was focused on building my dad's business. That required a huge amount of patience from someone who thought they were great. But that patience paid off in the end. So if you're feeling impatient or frustrated with your progress, take a step back and focus on the long game. Don't let instant gratification or outside validation distract you from your goals. Stay committed, stay patient, and success will come.",

    "title": "Scaling a business in 2025",
    "headline": "If I were starting a new business from scratch, how would I scale it using today’s tactics? That’s a question I get asked all the time on my Tea with GaryVee show or in DMs, and was even asked recently by Codie Sanchez on her podcast. The answer is easy: content.",
    "post_text": "If I were starting a new business from scratch, how would I scale it using today’s tactics? That’s a question I get asked all the time on my Tea with GaryVee show or in DMs, and was even asked recently by Codie Sanchez on her podcast. The answer is easy: content. I know some business owners are skeptical. “I own a laundromat. Why would social media have anything to do with my business?” To them, a content strategy seems like something that only influencers and public-facing brands need to think about. Why would a paint store or an accountant firm or a pest control company need to make social media posts? They couldn’t be more wrong. Remember, you have to look for where the attention is. And right now, it’s on the seven major social media platforms: Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest. If you’re looking to grow your business and you’re still thinking about billboards and direct mail, I need you to join me in 2025. When was the last time you clicked on a banner ad? Exactly. Posting every day, and even multiple times a day, is the best thing you can do for your business. And I’m not talking about ads (not yet)... I’m talking about organic social content, and a lot of it. I’ve seen it work for hundreds of companies, and it can work for you, too. What Kind Of Content Works? So if you’re going to be posting multiple times a day on all seven platforms, what are you going to be posting about? That’s the best part — it doesn’t matter. It’s not about your first post. It’s not about your 19th post or even your 100th post. It’s about putting in the reps of posting every day until you find the content that works. This worked out extremely well recently with one of VaynerMedia’s clients, Miralax. This won’t surprise you, but they were getting about 363 views on average on their social posts. The videos were beautifully executed, with nice graphics and a soundtrack, but they just weren’t reaching an audience. We tried lots of different styles and ideas, knowing that eventually one would hit. Then one day, we made a post that got 15 million views. One post, out of nowhere. And it had real world financial consequences — Miralax’s Amazon sales rank jumped by hundreds of places in a week just because of that one post. So don’t spend time worrying about making the perfect first (or 19th) post… it doesn’t matter how beautifully lit the video is or if your hair looks great or if you script out the right words. The point is to post post post post… until you find something that works. Learning How To Make Ads For 50 years we've been trying to figure out if the creative is good, in meetings, focus groups, animatics and fake reports. The social media algorithms have solved this problem for us. Now you already know what’s going to work before you spend a single dollar on ads. So once your posts start to hit and you find the content that works, it’s time to double down on it and turn that organic content into ads. You can take your TikTok post that went viral and post it on Facebook, spending $50 in media to amplify it within a 5 mile radius of your shop. But remember to only boost the posts that got great engagement from the audience. It’s a simple strategy: let the audience pick the winners, then amplify. It’s also crucial to make sure you’re making minor tweaks to the creative so that it’s contextual for the platform you’re posting on. Whether that’s changing the copy or text on-screen, adding the right trending audio or something else. Find what works organically, modify for each platform, and only then do you put dollars behind it. But as you’re working through this strategy, don't forget that creative can't get views unless people like it or are interested. You need to wait until you find that video that hits, and use that as your ad. Marketing is built on relevance, and relevance leads to consideration. When you consider, then you might buy. Advertising matters — It’s always mattered and it will always matter. And learning how to be remarkable at social means that not only will your ads will reach their intended audience, but they’ll be tested and proven, making your business dramatically bigger. Why Brand Wins In The Long Run Not only is this strategy for small businesses a winning way to build social media ads, it’s a huge opportunity to build brand. If you’re a paint store posting videos everyday about what the newest Pantone color is for 2025 and the top 5 mistakes DIYers make when trying to paint an accent wall and the best tool for painting moulding, then people will start getting to know your shop, and the next time they need paint, guess who they’re going to go to? That’s because you’ve built a brand and they associate trust, or humor, or whatever you’ve built with your business. Not only that, it’s the one thing that can never be commoditized. Your brand is always yours, even in an AI world. It’s your copyright. That will start to become increasingly important as AI grows at an astronomical rate. Off To A Great Start… Now Keep Going! Now that you’ve learned how to get organic content to work, and you’ve started to realize what content you should be spending dollars on, you’re also starting to get closer with the audience, which means you understand their wants more. You’ve also begun to know who to hire around you, because you’re an active participant in the social landscape in your area of expertise. So now as technology continues to grow and change, keep going! Live social shopping and AI are the biggest opportunities on the horizon, and you’re ready to meet them as they come and be rewarded with all of that new, underpriced attention!

    "title": "Commerce-tainment: The Next Frontier of Social Media",
    "headline": "If you asked me right now, out of all the options in the world, how to make money in the next five years in America, live shopping is at the very top of my list. In fact, I would argue that live social shopping is the only potential thing that Amazon should be worrying about in their domination.",
    "post_text": "If you asked me right now, out of all the options in the world, how to make money in the next five years in America, live shopping is at the very top of my list. In fact, I would argue that live social shopping is the only potential thing that Amazon should be worrying about in their domination. That’s how convicted I am, and that’s also why I’m writing this month’s newsletter–so that every one of you reading this right now can start doing your homework on why live shopping and, more specifically, a concept I call “commerce-tainment” is truly the next frontier of the social media game. What Is Commerce-tainment? Commerce-tainment is exactly what it sounds like: commerce and entertainment. To put it simply, it’s basically QVC on social media. Many of you may remember how big the Home Shopping Network was back in the ‘80s. Back then, consumers had to actively grab the remote, turn to the shopping channel, and wait for the program to showcase an item they were actually interested in. The way these social media algorithms work today is by bringing the shopping to you. You no longer have to seek it out; now, you’ll be scrolling your social media feed and then boom, there’s a TikTok live served straight to your phone. Better yet, the algorithm also knows your interests. It knows that you like graphic t-shirts, or vitamins, or sports, or beauty, or anime, and it’s feeding you accordingly. This is what makes commerce-tainment so huge. Attention is the ultimate asset, and these social platforms have the attention. You add live shopping to that environment and the impact that’s going to have on media, retail, and the product/service industry is ridiculous. Now, the trick is actually bringing entertainment. There are so many ways to do this, but it all boils down to one question: What value are you bringing to the audience? Whoever Brings The Most Value, Wins Many of you may know that I have a regular Q&A series called Tea with GaryVee where members of my community can join me live on Whatnot to ask me business questions or advice. If you’ve watched the show, you’ll know that I also feature a variety of different collectibles from my company, VeeFriends. Everything from stickers, to collectible card packs, mugs, t-shirts, hats and more gets added to my Whatnot storefront for people to browse and shop throughout the show. On the one hand, I’m providing insane value: an hour packed with tactical advice on business, life, and career. On the other hand, I’m educating my audience on the VeeFriends IP, all while giving them the opportunity to shop. I’m doing commerce while entertaining through providing value. Earlier this year, I did a 7-hour livestream on Whatnot where we sold $40K worth of t-shirts in two hours. If I had done my best social media, non-live shopping advertising, we would have made maybe $3K in sales. Please understand, this is real. Here’s another scenario. Imagine you’re a physical trainer. You can go on Whatnot or TikTok and start a live stream giving people tips on health and fitness, but then, maybe you add some merch into the mix. Maybe you have some hats or some hoodies, or maybe you have a special fascia scraper that you use while demonstrating different exercises. You’re leveraging your fitness expertise to build awareness and entertain, but you’re doing it on a commerce platform. As long as you have value to deliver and a product to sell, you’re doing yourself a huge disservice if you don’t get started with live social shopping today. Why Does Commerce-tainment Work? Why does it work? Because human behavior likes to buy in real time. For example, I’m someone who is extremely disciplined and I don’t generally like to buy stuff, and yet even I have bought things on Whatnot and TikTok Shop in the live experience because of the momentum. I’m already there, I see the product, I like it, I buy it. It’s frictionless, convenient, and you’re almost paying for an experience. Think of it this way. What do you get when you go to a standup comedy show or a concert or a sporting event? What do you take home? Nothing physical, but you’re paying for the entertainment experience. I believe the same thing is true of commerce-tainment, only you get the experience plus the physical product. There’s a subconscious underlying layer of the entertainment value that’s going on, and I think the hype and the excitement of purchasing live cannot be underestimated. It’s enjoyable; it’s a more fun way to shop than to see a picture in your Instagram feed. I could make an ad saying, “VeeFriends is the next Pokémon. Get in early! I’m GaryVee and I’m telling you right now, you’re going to regret not buying this for $40.” That’s a good ad; it will do fine, but I’m telling you that it would do even better in real time as commerce-tainment because I can also interact with the audience. I can answer their questions. I can respond in real time to their concerns. I can offer behind-the-scenes alpha on the VeeFriends IP for my community. I can bring on exciting guests and do spontaneous giveaways. It all fuels the shopping experience, and whether you’re a content creator with a CPG business, a small business or a big brand, you’re losing out on a ridiculous arbitrage if you don’t jump on live social shopping right now. How Commerce-taiment is Changing the Retail Space TikTok Shop is real, Whatnot is real, and what these platforms are doing now, I predict will happen to every platform. Meta’s not going to sit around and let them have it, and so they’re going to figure out what they’re going to do. Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Twitter/X, YouTube… we’re in for a wild rise in America of live shopping on social media and retail sites. I’m already moving fast during this era and I think you should do the same. In my brain, 20% of all social media content is live shopping. It’s not there yet, but it will be. The world has changed: more and more people are online shopping, brick and mortar rents are getting harder to justify. If you’re a normal store in a small town on Wednesday at 3pm, there is nothing going on. The retail traffic is changing. The fact that you can turn your little boutique into a studio now and your customers can go live shopping is amazing. In fact, in five years, I believe you’ll walk down a busy street and half of the employees will be doing commerce-tainment. People be turning stores into filming and streaming studios simply because they’re going to have to. That’s how huge this is. Six years ago I was yelling at everybody to be on TikTok. Many didn’t listen and missed the height of organic growth with that window of opportunity. Now, I’m yelling at you to do social shopping. I’m yelling at you to try commerce-tainment–start a Whatnot account, start going live on TikTok. Don’t have a product to sell? Start selling items from around your house! Either you’re going to listen now or you’re going to cry about not doing it later.

    "headline": "Hey LinkedIn, As many of you know, I’m incredibly bullish on AI. In fact, I truly believe that if you’re not setting aside at least one hour every day to explore, learn, ask questions and utilize this rapidly developing technology, you’re setting yourself up to be left behind.",
    "post_text": "Hey LinkedIn, As many of you know, I’m incredibly bullish on AI. In fact, I truly believe that if you’re not setting aside at least one hour every day to explore, learn, ask questions and utilize this rapidly developing technology, you’re setting yourself up to be left behind. The more I touch on this topic, the more I notice something troubling in my comments: so many of you are so consumed by your fear of what’s new and different that you’re unwilling to try. Now, I’m not here to convince you of anything. Those who live in a world of “no” will continue to be suffocated by fear. Meanwhile, those who operate with a “yes” or “maybe” mentality will win. That being said, I don’t want any of you to be on the losing side of the AI era, because–and let there be no confusion–the era has only just begun. So, for the May edition of LinkedIn 360, I want to take this opportunity to dive deep into what’s behind these fears, how AI will change the future of the workforce for all of us, and how you should be using AI now to prepare for what’s to come. AI Is Inevitable, Not Optional The first thing to understand is that technology doesn’t care about your opinions; it just keeps moving. I’m not pushing my community and all of my employees to learn about AI just because I want to–I’m doing it because I have no choice. This is the reality we’re facing, and I know because we’ve faced it before. Technology shifts have always happened: the tractor, the car, the computer, the plane, the boat, the sword, books–these were all things that changed the world in big ways. Fear is often the reaction to these big changes, but I promise you that it will get you nowhere. Rather than being afraid, why not take this opportunity to get ahead of the curve while so many are still asleep? If you’re reading this right now, you shouldn’t be fearing AI because it will take a full decade for everybody to fully calibrate this. In that decade, you need to go on the offense. If you’re reading this, that’s a start. Lean into adaptability, embrace change, and start learning how to leverage AI in your day-to-day life. How AI Will Change The Workforce When it comes to the topic of AI, it always boils down to the same concern: Will AI eliminate our jobs? The truth is, yes, some jobs may become obsolete, but there will also be many new opportunities for growth and advancement for those who are ready to adapt. For employees, it becomes a matter of, how can you use AI to level-up your skills and make your eight-hour day dramatically more impactful and productive? How do you take a task that once took you an hour and a half to complete and reduce it to 15 minutes? Most importantly, think about how much more of an asset you become when you work with AI instead of against it. For business owners and companies, this is major. It’s not necessarily about how many people you can fire and replace with AI, it’s about leveraging AI to retain the best of the best talent and increase your revenue with roughly the same overhead. The truth is, AI will change the workforce as we know it. Instead of hiring people to “do,” we’ll be hiring people to “think.” Those who are able to use AI as a partner to think, strategize, and create will rise to the top. The Architect Vs. The Mason Think about it this way. In life, there are two groups: architects and masons. The architect has the vision, lays out the plan, and oversees its execution. The mason does the physical labor and lays the bricks. I believe that, in the world that’s coming, a lot of that labor will be done by AI. Many of the tasks that drive our industries every day will be done much quicker and much more efficiently, so, I ask you–where does that leave the masons? You want to win in the new world? You need to become the architect. If you’re reading this right now and you know that most of your job is taking commands from other people, you may be in trouble. On the other hand, if you can make that strategic pivot from a doer to a thinker, there’s no need to fear AI. In fact, it will only make you stronger. How To Use AI Right Now I encourage every one of you to spend an hour every day using AI. It starts with using chatbot apps like ChatGPT and Perplexity. You can use them as a search engine, yes, but you can also use them as a thinking partner to work through different projects or problems. Don’t overthink it. I like to use the voice function to talk to ChatGPT directly. If you’re afraid of what AI means for your job or career, you can use AI to brainstorm a strategy for yourself. Use it to help refine your resume, your content, to help write your blogs, social media captions, LinkedIn posts, scripts for videos, etc. This is all a game of becoming the best prompt engineer. In other words, learning how to ask the right questions. Remember, the goal is not to use ChatGPT solely like a search engine; it’s to use it the same way you would dialogue with somebody who’s an expert in anything. In the world that’s coming, prompt engineering will be your superpower. Adaptability Wins At the end of the day, this is about adaptability. When faced with change, do you run or do you embrace it? I hope after reading this that you’ll lean into curiosity instead of fear. As always, thank you for reading!

        "comment": "My field, Mindful Medical Massage & Yoga Therapy, might last longer, but Mayo Clinic, some Health Spas, & a network of 8 Medical Massage Clinics in Singapore, are already using AI-driven MassageBots. Elon Musk says his Optimus Gen 3 humanoid robot already does massage, w/hands delivering 22 angles of movement! And they're developing human-like skin. Such therapists who give a repetitive, \"standard\" massage or yoga class might be the first to get replaced. Especially since a number of providers say they cannot find enough trained therapists. Yet from MY P.O.V., what's ALSO expanding is, for example, recognition by Harvard Business Review of the HIGH value of Emotional/Creative/Relational (ECR) Intelligence, having its roots in the physical body & nervous system. Massage & Yoga are direct ways to get more in-touch with & enhance the body-based \"ECR Self,\" which AI is NOT so good at (YET). So I'm encouraging massage & yoga therapists to get more highly trained in complex strategies of therapy for pain & dysfunction, & also engaging new Clients in using similar therapy to enhance a Client's ECR Intelligence. And Therapists can use AI (Augmented Intelligence vs. \"artificial\") to find & engage with more interested & affluent Clients.",

I'm incredibly bullish on AI's potential, but I do see a significant concern when it comes to its application in the banking sector. Many people today are unaware that their accounts are being monitored by AI, which evaluates every single purchase they make. In some cases, simply buying a Powerball lottery ticket with credit card has categorized a client as a \"Gambler.\" AI is already recommending investment options to clients when it detects a large sum in their account at the end of the month. Perhaps it's a personal fear, but whenever AI holds a lot of personal information, there's always a risk of misuse, especially since almost no one truly understands how AI processes and evaluates this data.",

    "post_text": "Hey everybody, For the April edition of LinkedIn 360, I’m excited to share with you all the first official “Backseat Q&A,” a longform Q&A format where I answer questions from my community right from the back of a car. Of course, if you’ve been consuming my content for a while, you’ll know that this isn’t an entirely new thing for me. In fact, half of my DailyVee vlog series was essentially backseat Q&A captured during my travels in-between meetings, keynotes, and daily operations. That being said, I’m super pumped to bring you this content in a formal way, and I’m looking forward to filming some more wherever I can over upcoming travels. To prepare for this 2.5-hour road trip, my team sourced questions from multiple corners of my community: from Instagram and TikTok comments to my text community , and of course, to all of you here on LinkedIn and more. Why am I doing this? Well, I’m a big believer that part of strong brand-building is going deep with your existing community, versus always trying to reach new people. Longform formats like this allow me to do just that, and Q&A has always been a main pillar of my brand from The #AskGaryVee Show to Tea with GaryVee and now, Backseat Q&A. My friends, this is about providing value, and at the end of the day, whoever provides the most value wins. That being said, grab a snack or a beverage and settle in for 1.5 hours (after edits) of business and career advice. Introducing, Backseat Q&A: As always, thank you for reading and watching. Did you enjoy this Backseat Q&A format? I’d love to know your thoughts in the comments below. Check out the new show, Backseat Q&A , on YouTube. Out now!

    "post_text": "Hey LinkedIn, Before we jump into the March newsletter, I want to invite everyone reading this to join me for a special TWO HOUR EDITION of Tea with GaryVee . Tomorrow from 9-11 AM EST , join me for a live Q&A session where I answer questions from my community. If you have a question you’d like to ask me, submit it here and my team may choose yours for me to answer rapid-fire-style, or even invite you onto the show. Now, back to today’s message. For years, I’ve received hundreds of social media DMs, comments, and emails from young adults in their early twenties struggling to navigate life. By far some of my most frequently asked questions revolve around feeling lost, being trapped by the expectations of parents and loved ones, and not knowing which path to take after college. As we get closer and closer to graduation season, I thought this was the perfect time to address some of these issues. Whether you’re preparing to cross that graduation stage this May or June, you graduated some time in the last five years, or you’re not quite sure what your path is just yet, this is for you. Two Key Reminders For Your Early 20s First off, let there be no confusion. Regardless of if you’re graduating from college or not, there are two things I believe every twenty-something-year-old should always keep in mind: 1) You are entering some of the GREATEST years of your life. 2) This is your time to be MASSIVELY risk-oriented. Many of you reading this have got it all wrong. You’re approaching life like you approach school–trying to follow the rules, get things “right,” and do what you’re “supposed to” do. The reality is, there is no right or wrong. There is no syllabus and there are no teachers telling you what to do or which way to go. These are the years where you decide what’s best for you. Before you say, “but Gary, I can’t,” I want you to consider this. Most of you at this age have few real world responsibilities. You likely haven’t gotten married or started a family yet. You don’t have to take little Sally or Rick to their soccer lessons every day after school. That means you can afford to take risks that you might not be able to take in another 10, 20, or 30 years. You want to learn to snowboard? Do it. You want to travel the world? Do it. You want to start a podcast with your buddies, or build a t-shirt business, or move to another country? You can. It starts with getting really good at tuning out the outside noise and asking yourself one question: What do I want to do? Do What Works For YOU… Not Your Parents At 20, 21, 22 years old, so many are stuck in a comfort zone of doing what other people want them to do. How many of you picked a major in college because your parents thought it was the best choice? How many of you went to college in the first place because your parents thought it was the safest bet for your future, when really you wanted to start a business? This is not me judging parents; I’m incredibly empathetic to the fact that parents just want their children to be okay. On the other side, I’ve also seen what that pressure can do to kids. Many of you think that doing what your parents want you to do is the right thing, but what you’re really doing is setting yourself up for tons of resentment down the road. You want to actually have a good relationship with your parents? Sit down with them and have an honest conversation around your likes, dislikes, and what you want for your future. Then–and this is the hard part–actually go and do that. For some of you, they may not get on board. That’s okay. I promise you that the short-term discomfort of disappointing them upfront is way better than the long-term pain of realizing you lived your whole life based on somebody else’s thesis. Life is way, way more fun when you die on your own sword, AKA when you follow your own convictions, even if you lose. Get Off Your Parents’ Payroll Now, all that being said, if you’re gonna follow your own convictions and die on your own sword, make sure you’re doing it on your own dime, not your parents’. I see way too many young people talking down or complaining about their parents, yet mommy and daddy are still funding their entire lives. They’re paying for their Ubers, their gym memberships, their rent, etc. If this sounds familiar, it’s time to stand on your own two feet. You are capable–more capable than you think. Yes, I think you should follow your dreams because regret is by far the biggest poison in life. However, if you’re gonna follow your dreams, don’t talk down on your parents while living on their dime. Of course, it will be tougher to make your own way, but the adversity will lead to happiness. So much of success is just developing that grit and tenacity needed to keep going when other people would stop. That might mean making some sacrifices. Maybe you don’t need the fanciest new car or apartment. Maybe you don’t need to pay for five streaming subscriptions. Maybe you need to take a serious audit of your life and what you’re doing with your time after work. Is it pushing you closer to your goals or further away? Believe me, taking the step to stand on your own can be scary, but it will also help you build the confidence and trust in yourself that you’ll need to navigate the next chapters of your life. What To Do After College By now, some of you are thinking, “Sure, this all sounds good. But I still don’t know what I want to do with my life.” To that I say, of course you don’t–you haven’t tried anything! Think about it like this. For many of you, your twenties are the first time in life when everything is entirely up to you. If you’re feeling “lost” or “stuck,” I’d argue that you simply haven’t tasted enough things to figure out what you’re interested in. So, here are some ideas: 1. Travel And Learn Too many kids never leave the town they grew up in, or they take one study-abroad trip in college before working their lives away. No more. Now is the time to travel the country or the world. Grab a few buddies and take a road trip. Make use of your network and couch surf with friends in other states. Too expensive? Go sell some stuff from around your house, or educate yourself on flip life and travel hack for inexpensive flights. It’s possible. 2. Take On Risks Now is when you go high risk, high reward. How you define “risk” is up to you and what you’ve cared about up to this point. It might be “risky” to go against your parents’ wishes. For someone else, “risk” might be quitting the safe, stable job they hate for a lower paying job they think they’ll love. Either way, you only perceive these things as risks because they don’t live up to the opinions of other people. You don’t want to disappoint, but guess what? That’s fake hard. You know what’s really hard? Living a life full of regret because you never took the risks to do the things you felt drawn to do. 3. Find An Internship So many people think internships are all about learning an industry and gaining skills. In reality, that’s about 3% of the equation. I think the biggest value by far of being an intern is in building relationships. Don’t be a wallflower–network, put time on people’s calendars to meet over lunch, etc. I don’t care where you intern, but you need to have a “shake hands and kiss babies” type of mentality. Meet everyone, be kind, take initiative, and please understand that the human connections you make will be the only true ROI of an internship. 4. Start Your Own Business Even if you’re about to graduate college, most people stay stuck in a high school mentality where they’re too afraid of what other people will think or say to actually execute on their ideas. If you want to start a business–and I’m talking, if you have true entrepreneurial DNA–you’re going to have to get over it. Get over the noise, get over the trolls, get over the comments from the naysayers. Put your head down and do the work. Get really great at making content on all the platforms that matter. Build a personal brand and give away as much value as you can for free. If you’re just starting out, it will take time to leverage your content to land clients, but if you’re good enough, the clients will appear. (But first, you have to give yourself permission to actually start the business.) 5. Take A Lower Paying Job You Love If you didn’t know by now, more money does not equal more happiness. If you have a job with a great salary that pays you for your great life in your great house, but you hate your life Monday through Friday, that’s not winning. Winning can look like taking a different job for lower pay in a new industry that you’re excited about. Trust me, there’s more to life than living for the weekend. Go find a job you enjoy. 6. Launch A Creative Project With Your Friends Go start that podcast, that band, that startup, that YouTube channel, that comedy troupe–whatever! If it’s on your heart and you have a couple of buddies down for the cause, do it. Use your twenties to flex your creative muscles as much as you can. 7. Taste Different Things This one is for those of you that don’t know where to start because you don’t know what your passions are. If you don’t know, good news–you can try literally anything. Taste things. Try different jobs, industries, and projects just to get a sense for how they make you feel. If you ever feel pressured to do one thing or fit neatly into a box, just remember that I do garage sales, sports cards, wine, business, etc. There IS no box unless you put yourself in one. Staying curious about yourself and your interests is the quickest way to build self-awareness around who you really are. 8. Build Interpersonal Relationships Making connections is key even outside of the office. Not a social butterfly. That’s no excuse. Social media makes it easier than ever to insert yourself into existing conversations and build relationships with people by sharing your two cents. If you’re not sure what I mean, check out my article, The $1.80 Strategy To Grow Your Business Or Brand . I wrote this back in 2017 about Instagram, but the message holds true today. Whether on Instagram, LinkedIn, X, etc., this is how you network in today’s landscape. 9. Build Your Personal Brand Last month’s LinkedIn newsletter was all around the importance of building a personal brand , and now I’m doubling down. Please understand, this is the perfect time to start building your brand. I was 30 years old before I made my first piece of content–don’t be like me. Start early, AKA right now. No matter where you want to go with your life and career, you should be documenting everything you possibly can. Make things–write, draw, paint, sing, film, edit–and then post it. Put yourself out there, provide value, give it away for free, and build a community around just being you. You’ll be amazed at how many opportunities will come. 10. Go Try To Become Beyoncé You probably think I’m kidding here, but I’m 100% serious. Too many young people half-ass their dreams of a music career because someone–mom, dad, ex-partner–told them it wasn’t practical. The truth is, what they’re really afraid of is that they’re not good enough to “make it” in music. If music is what you love, you should absolutely pursue it, but you’ve also got to be good. It’s not as simple as loving music. Are you leveraging social media to maximize your exposure? Are you putting in the reps of creating new songs and posting daily? Are you reaching out to peers for collaborations? Especially in today’s modern social media landscape and platforms like TikTok, one piece of content can change your life. The opportunity to be “discovered” in music or arts has never been higher. Go release a song every day on TikTok until something pops. Go produce 100 beats and collab with other artists. The simple fact of the matter is, if you want to be Beyonce, you’ve got to “bleed” like Beyoncé. Dream big, but make sure your actions match the ambitions coming out of your mouth. 11. Find Your Idol And Provide Value In your early twenties, it’s not about stacking money. It’s about stacking opportunities. Want to be an artist or a designer or an entrepreneur or whatever? Go find your idol–that person whose life you want to live–and offer to work for them. The great thing about being in your twenties is that when you’re that young, a lot of the time what you have to offer is sheer energy, grit, and humility. You’re often in a place in life where you can make sacrifices that others can’t, so go the extra mile, figure out what the decision-makers need, and deliver on that. Get “close to the sun” of whatever it is you want to be and make it worth their while by providing so much value, they can’t deny you. You’ll get a hundred “no’s,” but all it takes is one “yes.” 12. Live With Eight Roommates Some of you are probably freaking out, wondering how you can actually do any of this without real money. My answer to you would be that sometimes, you have to be willing to take a step back financially to take a step forward in life. These are the years where you can live in an apartment with eight roommates and split rent. These are the years when you can afford to eat inexpensive, crappy food. Too many people are unwilling to downgrade their lifestyle temporarily, even if it means upgrading their happiness. Ask yourself, what’s really important? Give Yourself A Little More Grace Lastly, if you’re in your 20s, chances are you’re probably being too hard on yourself. Give yourself some grace. Enjoy the process. Too many of you are constantly beating yourselves up for not being “there” yet. Where is “there,” anyway? Who gets to decide but you? Wherever you’re trying to get to, you’ve got a ridiculous amount of time. When I was 34 years old, I was still working in my father’s liquor store. I’m 49 now and I’m still ridiculously excited because I know I still have another 50 years to play the game. If I’m not worried about “running out of time,” why are you? Trust me, the “come up” is the best part. Don’t stress in your twenties; revel in the joy that you’re just starting. My friends, if you’re under 30 years old, you haven’t even started yet. Last year, I had the pleasure of giving the commencement speech at NYU Stern Business School. I would love to leave you with the video of my speech as I really believe it can help every new graduate and young person under 30: As always, thank you for reading. If you got value from this month’s newsletter, I’d love to hear from you in the comments below.

    "title": "Why It’s ALWAYS A Good Idea To Build Your Personal Brand",
    "headline": "Hey LinkedIn, I think we need to talk about a concept I’ve spent my entire life and career on: personal brand. When the term “personal brand” first started hitting the scene in 2009, ‘10, ‘11, ‘12, I was at the forefront of making awareness for it.",
    "post_text": "Hey LinkedIn, I think we need to talk about a concept I’ve spent my entire life and career on: personal brand. When the term “personal brand” first started hitting the scene in 2009, ‘10, ‘11, ‘12, I was at the forefront of making awareness for it. Around that time, however, lots of people thought it was “yucky” because self-promotion, when out of whack, is not good. People didn’t want to be seen as full of themselves or ridiculous for trying to “build a brand” publicly, but I knew that most people just weren’t looking at it the way I was. Whenever I would be out somewhere and the topic of personal brand-building would come up, people would literally attempt to get into debates with me. Every time, I would simply say, “Okay. Personal brand–let me say it a different way: Reputation .” All of a sudden, all their confusion and anger completely melted away. I knew then that this was just an issue of semantics. People didn’t want to build a personal brand just because they didn’t like the way it sounded, or worse, because they were afraid of what other people might think of them for trying. But when you think about brand building as building the best reputation you can as an entrepreneur, executive, employee, leader, small business owner or anything else, it becomes clear: Why wouldn’t you want to build the best reputation you can? Why wouldn’t you want to put your best foot forward? Why wouldn’t you want to leverage your skills, talents and expertise for bigger and better opportunities? That being said, for the February edition of LinkedIn 360, I want to talk about why it’s ALWAYS–and I mean always–a good idea to build your personal brand (and why it’s never too late to start). The Power Of A Personal Brand The reality is that personal brand means optionality. The amount of people that started building their personal brands in 2008 after I wrote Crush It! was insane, not to mention the emails I received for years of people thanking me for writing that book and helping them realize they could make money on their passions. There was a clear turning point at that time where many people started losing their jobs due to the economy getting tighter. However, because those people who had read my book had started to build their personal brands, they were able to get jobs immediately… and they also saw that their peers who were not on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn at the time, were not as fortunate. As I sit here today in 2025, I implore everyone reading this to just start. Stop waiting, stop putting it off, stop delaying because you don’t have the right camera, or equipment or setup… Do you have to build a brand? Of course not. You don’t have to do anything–we always have a choice… but every day that you’re not building your personal brand is a day that you’re limiting your upside. The Best Way To Build A Brand? Be You Every day I get messages from people saying, “Gary, I want to build a brand but I’m no good on video”... “I want to build a brand but I hate the way I look on camera” … “I want to build a brand but I’m not like you.” My answer to these people is simple: Don’t try to be me. Be you. I know that I have an extreme personality. It’s very high-energy, very excitable, and lots of people love it, but I also know that it doesn’t work for a lot of people. Don’t look at how I communicate; find your own way. Maybe video isn’t your thing, but you could be an amazing writer or podcaster. Maybe you could start a blog or a substack, or maybe you could create video content where you just do voiceovers over b-roll so that you never have to be on camera. There are 300 million different ways to win; find what works for you and do that at scale. It’s NEVER Too Late To Start A Personal Brand The other comment I get all the time is some variation of the following: “But I missed my moment!” “But it’s too late!” “But I’m too old!” Is it ever too late to create a personal brand? The answer is no–emphatically no, it is never too late. I am so passionate about this. With the advancements in health, I believe many of you reading this are going to live another 20 years, 30 years, 40 years past what you expect. The truth is, many of you are not even at the halftime of your life. So even if you’ve never picked up a camera or a pen or a podcast mic in your life, you can start today. Stop overthinking and start executing. Building a brand is everything. I’ve been telling people for years, go build your personal brand because you can always deploy that leverage against something . If you want to know how to win in a world–especially a world that’s quickly moving towards AI for a lot of the things we do–getting serious about building a brand is one of the best things you can do. So start now. Thank you again for reading. If you got value from this month’s newsletter, I’d love if you dropped a comment below.

    "post_text": "Hey LinkedIn, As we close out the first month of 2025, I know that this is the time when many of you are taking audits of your goals, your new year’s resolutions, your careers and your happiness. I also know that by this time, a ridiculous number of you have already begun to take your feet off the gas. Maybe you’ve backslid on the resolutions you set at the start of the year, or maybe you got a little too high on the micro wins, and now you’re getting complacent… This is your reminder: no matter where you are right now and no matter the progress you have or haven’t made, it’s not too late to turn things around . My friends, this is your checkpoint. If you are reading this right now, this is your sign to double-down. That being said, if you’ve found yourself here at the end of January, unhappy with where you are, I want to leave you with some advice to get back on track. Here are three tips on how to bounce back and make the remaining 11 months of this year your best yet! Become a Deep Practitioner in Something Whether you do it for your business or just for yourself as a hobby, practice something on a deep level. One of the reasons my agency VaynerMedia has grown to be such a leader in the industry is because I myself use social media every single day. I understand the trigger points that make things successful in a creative world, and I understand the context of the platforms that matter in a modern marketing world. I write the copy for each and every one of my Instagram posts, I day trade attention , and I study what’s happening in culture. In other words, I’m in the dirt being a practitioner–and I can tell you all this because I only talk about things I’ve lived. These are the same tenants that helped me build my dad’s business in my Wine Library Days. I spent hours watching customers’ behaviors when they walked into the store. I spent years filming episode after episode of Wine Library TV before it got any real traction . It’s not about setting an arbitrary goal–it’s about loving the process of going after it. It’s about the years, the reps… As we head into February, ask yourself: are you really being a practitioner every single day? Practice Self-Awareness I think self-awareness is about knowing your strengths, weaknesses, likes, dislikes, the things you’re great at, the things you suck at…Ultimately, it comes down to knowing who you are and how you operate. Self-awareness is also important when it comes to actually sticking to your goals. For example, a few years ago, I had a goal of improving my health. While I was amazing at holding myself accountable when it came to my businesses or my family, I was not so great at prioritizing my physical health. After asking myself why, I realized that it was because that was one area of my life where I lacked that source of outside accountability. In business, I’m accountable to my employees. As a parent, you’re obviously accountable to your children–but in fitness, I wasn’t accountable to anybody but myself. So, what did I do? I hired a full-time trainer and it changed everything. You can learn more about how I finally got serious about my health here , but ultimately, it was self-awareness that allowed me to reverse-engineer my goal. Instead of spending the next 11 months chasing some goal without a plan, I want you to look in the mirror and get really honest with yourself about some things: What makes you tick? How do you operate the best? What do you actually like to do? Are you really “lazy,” or do you just hate whatever it is you’re pursuing? Do you really want the things you say you want–the job, the house, the business–or do you just want whatever you think those things can do for you? In 2025, let self-awareness lead you to your goals. Eliminate Complaining Finally, this should go without saying but… You want to really crush the rest of 2025? You have to stop complaining. Looking at the negative, seeing the glass as half empty, and complaining are the absolute biggest wastes of time a human being can engage in. I highly recommend–whether it is through therapy or just practicing positive perspective–cut your complaining in half until you are no longer used to it. Do whatever works for you: writing post-it notes, listening to positive podcasts, meditating… anything. It truly is one of the biggest things that can stand in the way of success, both professionally and personally. As always, thank you for reading… and remember, your new year’s resolutions aren’t about January 1st; they happen whenever YOU decide. Have a question for me?

    "title": "L.O.V.E. - A Four-Part Framework for Life and Career Success",
    "headline": "Hey LinkedIn, Wishing a happy holiday season to everybody reading this right now. I couldn’t let 2024 come to an end without one last newsletter for my LinkedIn community.",
    "post_text": "Hey LinkedIn, Wishing a happy holiday season to everybody reading this right now. I couldn’t let 2024 come to an end without one last newsletter for my LinkedIn community. That being said, for the December edition, I wanted to share a new framework that I think every employee, creator or business owner – especially those under 30 years old – should learn. Consider implementing this in the new year to maximize success in 2025 and beyond. By success, I don’t mean profits – although there’s nothing wrong with that. This concept goes much deeper; it’s about a mindset that can set you up for macro happiness. Whether you’re just starting your career or navigating your 20s feeling lost or uncertain, I’m confident this will help you. Introducing my four-part framework for life and career success: L.O.V.E. – Learn, Observe, Value, Execute. Let’s break it down. L – Learn Learning is a superpower, but here’s the thing: Too many people undervalue the opportunity to learn early in their careers. So many are busy trying to “get rich quick” or chasing whatever they think is the “next big thing,” when in reality, the way to win is to put yourself in the best position to learn by getting close to the sun. In other words, go find someone who’s a juggernaut in the field or industry you’re interested in and work for them. Take an internship, be the assistant; whatever you can do to get close to the sun will shape your future. Whether it’s through a new job, listening to podcasts, reading books, or just paying attention to what’s happening in culture or the world around you, your ability to win will be predicated on how much you’re willing to learn. That’s why curiosity is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated traits there is. O – Observe Observation is the twin sister of learning. The great thing is that even if you haven’t gotten that “yes” that gets you closer to the sun of what you want to be, you can always observe what’s happening around you. Ask yourself: What are people talking about? Where is the attention? What does it mean and why is this happening? Curiosity is a framework that will seriously change your life. Think about this: When you’re on a plane, do you notice how people board? At a restaurant, do you watch how they read menus? Observation isn’t just about watching; it’s about connecting dots. Many of you know that I started my career working in my father’s liquor store. When I started out, I did a lot of unconventional things just to be able to observe the customers and their habits. I watched everything: which aisles people went down after they entered the store, what items they picked up while waiting in line at the register, which wines sold better or worse than I expected, which signs were positioned to catch the most attention from people walking in… I could go on. My point here is that observation is free–there are no barriers. It’s the little things you notice today that can give you insights that lead to massive breakthroughs tomorrow. So, be curious, day trade attention , and observe as many things as possible. V – Value I always say, whoever provides the most value wins. The problem is, many people are only looking out for what they can gain, instead of what they can give somebody else. When you’re DMing contacts, or attending networking events, or making cold calls, are you asking yourself what you can bring to the person on the other end of the interaction, or are you asking, “what’s in it for me?” Some of you may be navigating your first jobs, and you may be thinking, but Gary, what if I don’t have any value to offer yet? To that I say value can take many different forms. Maybe you’re great at marketing to your own age group, maybe you’re a genius at simplifying processes, or maybe your value is in the work that other people don’t want to do. When you’re young, a lot of the time what you have to offer is sheer energy, grit, and humility. You’re often in a place in life where you can make sacrifices that others can’t to go the extra mile, so figure out what the decision-makers need and deliver on that. Whether it’s taking notes, organizing inboxes, or solving big problems, providing value early on will set you apart. Whatever you do, remember this: value isn’t about what you think is important. It’s about what’s valuable to the decision-makers around you. Them, not you. E – Execute Finally, we’ve made it to the “E.” This is the big one and it’s where so many people go wrong: execution. There tends to be a lot of talk, especially around this time of year, about what people are “gonna do.” Do you know what’s a lot better than saying, “I’m gonna”?--saying, “I did.” Too many people fall in love with talking about their goals instead of actually working towards them. Why? It’s because execution is hard. It’s messy, it’s uncomfortable, and there are lots of “L”s aka losses involved. Everybody wants the trophies, but nobody wants to practice. If you want to win, fall in love with losing–because most people are scared of it. So, stop posturing, stop talking about what’s coming, and start actually building. The “trophies” aren’t in the wins themselves, but in the process of executing to get there. L.O.V.E.

    "headline": "Hey everybody, I hope yesterday was an amazing holiday for everyone who celebrated. While so many are enjoying down time with loved ones, for all the business owners and marketers out there, this is not the time to rest, but the time to amp things up.",
    "post_text": "Hey everybody, I hope yesterday was an amazing holiday for everyone who celebrated. While so many are enjoying down time with loved ones, for all the business owners and marketers out there, this is not the time to rest, but the time to amp things up. With today being Black Friday, I want to kick off the biggest sales period of the year with a deep dive into what I believe is a huge untapped opportunity for so many of you. I’m talking about live social shopping. If you’re looking for the competitive advantage in the 2025-2030 era, keep reading to learn how you can leverage live shopping to get your slice of the pie in this exploding market. Live Shopping is Already Here Nine years ago during an episode of The #AskGaryVee show , I said that retail and selling stuff on livestream platforms was very real to me. At the time, I was discussing the potential for QVC-like programming on platforms like Meerkat and Periscope. Now, time has passed and the most relevant platforms in society have evolved, but my thesis stands strong: live shopping on social platforms is going to be huge–and it’s already begun. I want you to go to Google and type in “Chinese creator makes millions on livestream.” Last year, Zheng Xiang Xiang sold around $14M in goods in just one week on Douyin livestream (Douyin is the version of TikTok available in China, owned by the same parent company, Bytedance). While the company has since implemented some rules to regulate this type of selling, the fact remains: there are tens and hundreds of millions of dollars in live shopping happening right now. The good thing for you and I is that 95% of people still haven’t realized it’s happening. The Early Mover’s Advantage This has been the story of my career: I pay attention to human behavior and where the attention is, I do my 50 hours of homework, and I move before 95% of people realize something has “hit.” It’s what happened back in my wine business days. When I was helping build my father’s wine business, I stumbled across this thing called “the internet,” and after doing my research, I decided we needed to strike quickly. Everyone said I was crazy and that people would never buy wine online, but I knew I had something massive. I launched winelibrary.com , one of the country’s first e-commerce platforms for alcohol, and helped scale my dad’s business from $4 to $60M. Then, it happened again. When Google adwords were in their beginning stages, I bought wine-related keywords for mere cents when no one else could see the value in what I was doing… and then it happened again with TikTok. A few years ago, I was yelling to anyone who would listen that they should get on TikTok and strike while the platform was young. I knew that, just like all the big platforms before it, there would be a period of high organic reach before an inevitable decline–it’s the supply and demand of attention. Sure enough, I get comments, emails, and direct messages every day from people telling me how much they wish they listened and joined TikTok when they first heard me say it. Well, today, I’m saying the same thing about live social shopping. I know that 99% of the people reading this right now are undervaluing live shopping as a part of their 2025 marketing plan. You may have heard of TikTok Shop, or global selling platforms like Whatnot, but have you really dug in? Have you done your 50-100 hours of homework? Will you take the information in this newsletter and act on it, or will you be messaging me in a few months or next year saying, “Gary, I wish I’d listened”? Right now, you have the opportunity to be an early mover in a lane where most people are still asleep, and just like in poker, when you know you have a winning hand, you go all-in. Live e-commerce shopping has been a huge topic in China for almost a decade now, but I don’t think that people understand that we’re on the tipping point of live shopping in the U.S. I just sense that we’re going to be talking about live shopping in 2025 the way we talk about A.I. now, and the way we talked about blockchain in 2023… Make no mistake, it’s here. The question is what are you going to do about it? How To Leverage Live Social Shopping There’s a reason that QVC and HSN still work. There’s clearly something in the entertainment value, shopping impulses and the way we’re wired that makes us enjoy buying from a live environment–and I believe most if not all of the major platforms will be getting in on the game. TikTok Shop Let’s say you have a side business. The fact that you can have no followers on TikTok, go live tomorrow doing a show from your kitchen, and your livestream will start to show up in random people’s For You Page is ridiculous. That’s free awareness and distribution that you’ve not earned yet, but that the app is providing for you. This is a value that is so extraordinary, I can’t stress it enough. Whatnot As many of you know, I own an intellectual property called VeeFriends, my Pokémon-meets-Sesame Street, and I’m building the brand every day. Well, a few weeks ago, in the conference room right next to my office, I sold $150K worth of hoodies, sweatshirts, beanies and socks in four hours on Whatnot. This, my friends, is the power of live social shopping. Whatnot in particular has me very excited because of its global capabilities. For those who don’t know, Whatnot is a social marketplace where you can host or join live shows or auctions. Some of you may have tuned in for my last episode of Tea with GaryVee, or some of our recent VeeFriends livestreams, both of which I’ve been hosting on the Whatnot platform. That being said, I’d be humbled if you joined our Black Friday Megastream happening all day today, starting at 12PM ET . It’s gonna be our biggest show yet with four brand new products dropping during the stream: the 2024 VeeFriends Ornaments Mystery Collection, a Christmas Countdown Pin, a Fearless Fairy Retro Tee, and a Driven Dragon Retro Tee. We’ll also be selling discounted Vending Machine bundles direct to consumers for the first time ever. Come hang out with me and the team and get your holiday shopping done during the show! Back to the point… whether you’re looking for new ways to engage with your community or venturing into consumer packaged goods, Whatnot is a platform you should be exploring. Especially for those of you with an international community or consumer base, Whatnot is a game-changer because it allows you to sell to a global audience. If you’re from outside of the United States, you can buy seamlessly through the app and it’ll send your purchase directly to you. It also features the ability to bring special guests into your livestreams virtually for a more engaging, interactive experience. The Future of Live Shopping If you ask me, right now, how to make money in the next five years in America out of all the options in the world, live shopping would be at the very top of my list. If you’re a retailer and you have a physical location, like a Main Street, downtown store, you know that “Monday through Friday” is dead because the world is changing – people are doing more online shopping, rents are getting harder to justify, and more. In five years, I believe you’ll walk down Main Street and half of these store owners or their employees are going to be doing live shopping. They’re going to turn their stores into studios because the opportunity will be real. I believe retail in 2025 will become multichannel; it’ll be harder to survive just on brick-and-mortar. However, with the explosion of live shopping, you can have a first-mover advantage if you act now. As always, I hope you found value in this newsletter. I would love to hear from you.

The idea of live shopping and social commerce plays into your plan to make KDUBS a conversation starter, not just a product. 2️⃣ Competitive Advantage for 2025-2030 – You’re not trying to build some old-school retail store—you’re tapping into a next-gen approach by creating viral, social-driven, and personality-infused branding that thrives beyond traditional e-commerce. 3️⃣ Tying It Back to You – Your brain can’t do 8-hour shifts, but it can run the most engaging, out-of-the-box, interactive T-shirt launch of 2025. You’re proof that you don’t have to fit the traditional work model to own your lane in business. Gary, you’re talking live social shopping? I’m all in—because let’s be real, my brain retired from 8-hour shifts years ago. KDUBS launches 4/19/25 at 11:15 AM, and I’m ready to take T-shirt culture cosmic with the power of social hype, left-handed brilliance, and just the right amount of Just Yuck. 💙🚀 Would love your take—should I be livestreaming this launch? 🌙🔥 #KDUBS #FAMFAY #BossOfBallz #JustYuck #Always #4LIFE #LiveShoppingTakeover #BoilerUp #HammerDown",
